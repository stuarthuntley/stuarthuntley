Hello, I am Stuart Huntley. I am a computational biologist and have extensive experience performing comparative
genomic analysis on a broad range of organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates. I am deeply interested in the relationship
between genetic variation and alterations in physiology. I am proficient in NGS and long read wrangling, assembly, and
mapping for comparative analyses.
I am constantly striving to update my skillset and biological knowledge to maximize my effectiveness in my work. I am
currently working on certifications for my Python, R, shell scripting, and machine learning skills and it is my goal to
build a portfolio on my github account representing my skills in the next several months.
I can be reached by email at stuhuntley@gmail.com
